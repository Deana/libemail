This is a small example of how to whitelist a DNSBL zone using MapReduce style programming techniques.

It uses Perl and Gearman, and records the stats to syslog.

Example:

$ perl gm_rbl_whitelist.pl xbl out

And check the syslog:

$ perl -lane 'print $1 if /Job complete:\s+(\S+)/' gearman.log | perl ~/bin/stats.pl -
Mean:     2.6589  Var:     0.1328  Std Dev:     0.3644  Trimmed mean:     2.6090

$ perl -lane 'print $1 if /Job complete:\s+(\S+)/' gearman.log | wc -l
49

Which tells us that the 49 jobs tool on average 2.6 seconds to complete.  The variance was quite low, so we know that there weren't any problem nodes taking longer than expected to complete the task.

In a more robust setup, the job schedule should be able to keep track of how long each job took to complete, so that it has a general idea of how long the average job takes.  Then, if there are any outlier jobs that take statically longer to complete, the job server can re-queue that job to a different job server and perhaps remove the problem job server from the worker pool.  This can arise from a particular machine in the worker pool having issues of its own, causing its worker applications to execute slowly.
